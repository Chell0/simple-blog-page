            <h2>HTML and CSS in Brief</h2>
            <p class="quote">The internet is full of people saying you need to learn every language, framework, and tool in order to be a front-end web developer. The advice is well-intentioned but damaging because it can be so overwhelming that you don’t know where to begin, so you never begin. What you need is to focus on one thing at a time and not get distracted worrying about everything else.</p>
            <p>At the root of the Web’s success is a simple, text-based markup language that is easy to learn and that any device with a basic Web browser can read HTML. Every Web page requires at least some HTML, it wouldn’t be a Web page without it. As you will learn in greater detail as you move through this book, HTML is used to define your content’s meaning, and CSS is used to define how your content and Web page will look. Both HTML pages and CSS files (style sheets) are text files, making them easy to edit.</p>
            <p>HTML5 is a natural evolution of earlier versions of HTML and strives to reflect the needs of both current and future Web sites. It inherits the vast majority of features from its predecessors, meaning that if you coded HTML before HTML5 came on the scene, you already know a lot of HTML5</p>

            <p>You might be wondering who created HTML and CSS in the first place, and who continues to evolve them. The World Wide Web
            Consortium (W3C)—directed by the inventor of the Web and HTML, Tim Berners-Lee—is the organization responsible for shepherding
            the development of Web standards. Specifications (or specs, for short) are documents that define the parameters of languages like HTML and CSS. In other words, specs standardize the rules. Follow the W3C’s activity at www.w3.org</p>
            <p>For a variety of reasons, another organization—the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG, found at www.whatwg.org)—is
            developing the HTML5 specification. The W3C incorporates WHATWG’s work into its official version of the in-progress spec.
            With standards in place, we can build our pages from the agreed-upon set of rules, and browsers—like Chrome, Firefox, Internet
            Explorer (IE), Opera, and Safari—can be built to display our pages with those rules in mind. (On the whole, browsers implement
            the standards well. Older versions of IE, especially IE6, have some issues</p>
